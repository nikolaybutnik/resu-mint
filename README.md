## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.18.0 or newer)
- pnpm, npm, or yarn
- Docker and Docker Compose (for local Supabase development)
- OpenAI API key
- Tectonic (automatically downloaded during build): [Tectonic Documentation](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nikolaybutnik/resu-mint.git
   cd resu-mint
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up Supabase for local development:

   ```bash
   # Install Supabase CLI
   npm install -g @supabase/cli

   # This automatically applies the migration in supabase/migrations/
   npx supabase start
   ```

   This will start local Supabase services, apply the database migration to create all tables with Row Level Security policies, and display connection details.

4. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   
   # Local Supabase (from `supabase start` output)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_anon_key_here
   SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
   ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

### Database Management

The app uses a **dual-path data management system**:

- **Authenticated Users**: Data is stored in Supabase PostgreSQL with Row Level Security
- **Unauthenticated Users**: Data is stored in browser localStorage for immediate use

#### Database Schema

The database includes tables for:
- **`personal_details`** - Contact information and professional profiles

#### Local Development Commands

```bash
# Stop local Supabase services
npx supabase stop

# Reset local database (deletes all data) and apply pending migrations
npx supabase db reset

# View database in Supabase Studio
npx supabase start
# Open http://localhost:54323 in browser

# Apply database migrations
npx supabase migration up

# Generate new migration from schema changes
npx supabase db diff --file new_migration

# Create a new migration file
npx supabase migration new <name>

# Regenerate types after schema changes (only needed if you modify the migration)
npx supabase gen types typescript --local > src/lib/types/database.ts

## Architecture

ResuMint uses a modern, scalable Next.js architecture with intelligent caching and state management:

### Core Architecture
- **App Router**: Handles routing and API endpoints with TypeScript
- **Component Architecture**: Feature-based organization with shared utilities
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript with Zod validation schemas
- **Styling**: SASS modules with comprehensive mixin system for consistency

### State Management Architecture

ResuMint uses a modern Zustand-based architecture that eliminates prop drilling and provides clean separation of concerns:

#### **Clean Data Flow Pattern**
```
UI Layer → Action Layer → Store Layer → Persistence Layer
```

- **UI Layer**: Components handle user interaction and presentation
- **Action Layer**: Pure validation functions with no side effects
- **Store Layer**: Global state management with smart loading states
- **Persistence Layer**: Data caching and localStorage operations

#### **Zustand Store Features**
- **Single Source of Truth**: Each data type has one global store (personalDetails, settings, etc.)
- **Smart Loading States**: 
  - `initializing: boolean` - Shows skeleton during first load only
  - `loading: boolean` - Shows subtle feedback during operations
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic state restoration on save failures
- **Cache Integration**: Seamless integration with dataManager for persistence
- **Direct Access**: No prop drilling - any component can access stores directly

#### **Store Provider Pattern**
- **Centralized Initialization**: All stores initialized in root layout via `StoreProvider`
- **Automatic Setup**: Stores auto-initialize on app start
- **Performance Optimized**: Stores only load data when first accessed
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper type inference

#### **Migration Pattern for New Data Types**
Adding new data types follows a consistent pattern:

1. **Create Store**: `src/stores/newDataStore.ts` with standard interface
2. **Add to Provider**: Include in `StoreProvider.tsx` initialization
3. **Create Actions**: Pure validation functions in `src/lib/actions/`
4. **Update Components**: Use store hooks directly, no prop drilling
5. **Extend DataManager**: Add persistence methods if needed

This pattern ensures consistency and maintainability as the application scales.

#### **Architecture Benefits**
- **Eliminated Dual State Issues**: No more duplicate hook instances
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new data types with consistent patterns
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns across all layers
- **Performant**: Smart caching and minimal re-renders
- **Robust**: Multiple error handling layers with state recovery

### Data Flow Example: Personal Details

Here's how data flows through the architecture when a user submits personal details:

1. **UI Layer**: `PersonalDetails.tsx` handles form submission
2. **Action Layer**: `personalDetailsActions.ts` validates form data (pure function)
3. **Store Layer**: `personalDetailsStore.ts` manages state and calls persistence
4. **Persistence Layer**: `dataManager.ts` handles caching and localStorage operations

```typescript
// Component orchestrates the flow
const [state, formAction] = useActionState(async (prevState, formData) => {
  const result = await submitPersonalDetails(prevState, formData)
  if (result.success) {
    await store.save(result.data)  // Store handles state + persistence
  }
  return result
})
```

This pattern ensures:
- **Predictable data flow**: Always UI → Action → Store → Persistence
- **Single responsibility**: Each layer has one clear purpose
- **Error isolation**: Failures are contained and handled at appropriate layers
- **Testability**: Pure functions and clear interfaces

### User Experience Layer
- **Welcome Experience**: Progressive onboarding with smart step navigation and completion tracking
- **Loading States**: Skeleton components using design system mixins for consistent shimmer effects
- **Data Management**: Zustand stores with intelligent loading states for seamless UX

### AI & Processing Pipeline
- **Job Analysis**: Extracts keywords, skills, and requirements from job descriptions
- **Keyword Management**: Tracks usage statistics and prioritizes underused skills
- **Bullet Generation**: Context-aware AI prompting with keyword prioritization
- **Skill Processing**: Automatic skill extraction, intelligent categorization, and AI-powered skill suggestions

### Performance Optimizations

ResuMint implements a multi-tier caching system to minimize PDF generation latency and eliminate cold start delays:

#### PDF Generation Cache Strategy

**Cache Flow Decision Tree:**

| Step | Condition | Action | Performance | Details |
|------|-----------|--------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | User requests PDF | → Check cache directories | - | API route `/api/create-pdf` |
| 2 | Persistent cache exists? | ✅ Use persistent cache | ⚡ **Fast** (2-3s) | 496 packages pre-cached (~42MB) |
| 3 | Runtime cache exists? | ✅ Use runtime cache | ⏱️ **Medium** (4-8s) | Some packages cached |
| 4 | No cache found | ❌ Download packages | 🐌 **Slow** (8-12s) | Download + save to runtime cache |

**Cache Directory Priority:**
```
1st Priority: .vercel-cache/tectonic-build-cache  (Persistent, deployed with app)
2nd Priority: /tmp/tectonic-shared-cache          (Runtime, created on first request)
3rd Fallback: Download fresh packages             (Cold start scenario)
```

#### Cache Tiers Explained

1. **Persistent Cache (Pre-warmed)**
   - **Created**: During build process by `warm-tectonic-cache.js`
   - **Contains**: 496 LaTeX packages (~42MB) including comprehensive font collections
   - **Performance**: ⚡ **2-3 second** PDF generation
   - **Persistence**: Deployed with application, available immediately
   - **Environment**: ~19MB on local (macOS), ~42MB in production (Linux + fonts)

2. **Runtime Cache (On-demand)**
   - **Created**: By first PDF request when persistent cache is missing
   - **Contains**: Packages downloaded during runtime
   - **Performance**: ⏱️ **4-8 seconds** with some package downloads
   - **Persistence**: Shared across requests in same container instance

3. **Fallback Strategy**
   - **Triggers**: When no cache exists (rare scenarios)
   - **Behavior**: Downloads all packages fresh (8-12 seconds)
   - **Recovery**: Subsequent requests use newly created runtime cache

#### Additional Optimizations

- **Live Preview Service**: Debounced PDF generation with multi-tier caching
- **Request Queue Management**: Handles concurrent requests with intelligent deduplication
- **Local Storage Caching**: Persistent PDF caching for improved performance (utilizing blob size strategies)
- **Cache Warming**: Automated package download during build with fresh cache creation
- **Environment Adaptation**: Cache size varies by environment (local vs production) for optimal resource usage
- **Deployment Integration**: Cache included in deployment via Next.js `outputFileTracingIncludes`
- **Skeleton Loading**: Mixin-based loading states automatically sync with design system changes
- **Zustand State Management**: Global stores eliminate prop drilling
