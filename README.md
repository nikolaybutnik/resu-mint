# ResuMint: AI-Powered Resume Builder

## Overview

ResuMint is a modern web application that uses AI to create tailored, ATS-friendly resumes optimized for specific job descriptions. Powered by OpenAI's language models and built with Next.js, ResuMint automates resume customization with intelligent keyword analysis, generating bullet points that highlight your relevant skills and experiences. It produces professional PDF resumes using LaTeX and Tectonic, with real-time live preview capabilities ensuring clean formatting and precise typography.

This project is public, with a custom license allowing personal use and forks for non-commercial purposes. I plan to introduce user authentication and premium features (e.g., advanced templates, analytics) for commercial use in the future.
