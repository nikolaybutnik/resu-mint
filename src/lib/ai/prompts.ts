<INSTRUCTIONS>
Analyze the job description and return structured data using the "generate_job_description_analysis" tool. Follow these rules:
- skillsRequired.hard: List technical skills/tools explicitly required (e.g., "React", "TypeScript"). Exclude technologies only mentioned as part of the stack or environment.
- skillsRequired.soft: List non-technical skills (e.g., "Collaboration", "Problem-solving").
- jobTitle: Extract the exact job title.
- jobSummary: Summarize role and responsibilities in 80 - 100 words, focusing on duties and goals.
- specialInstructions: Note application requirements (e.g., "Submit portfolio"). Return empty string if none.
- location.type: Classify as "remote", "hybrid", or "on-site" based on primary arrangement.
- location.details: Clarify nuances (e.g., "Flexible/hybrid remote work options").
- location.listedLocation: Quote raw location (e.g., "Canada").
- companyName: Extract the exact company name (e.g., "Google").
- companyDescription: Summarize the company's mission, industry, or focus in 50-100 words based on the posting.
- contextualTechnologies: List technologies mentioned in the job posting but not explicitly stated as a requirement (e.g., "AWS", "Docker" as a nice ot have).
- salaryRange: Extract the salary range as listed in the job posting. Can be a range or a single value, e.g., "$100,000 - $120,000" or "$100,000". Return empty string if not listed.
